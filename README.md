# ANGULAR SSR (Server Side Rendering)

MEAN Stack - SSR Boilerplate project, contains Angular SSR and a Angular CSR project.

## BENEFIT

When you want a dashboard app with a landing page or some random pages with SEO (I know you can do a WordPress for landing page, but what if you want to do it in Angular) on a little side, than this boilerplate will come in little handy for you.  

## PERKS

- NodeJS Working Backend
- Mocks Browser functons (windows, document, and localstorage)
- Angular Server Side Rendering
- Angular Client Side Rendering

- Pretty quick on precommit
- TSLint Support with husky staged (you can remove the code from package.json if you like)
